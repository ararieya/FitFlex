# Phase 1 Project
# FIT FLEX

# Project Description
This project is a compilation of all the concepts I have learnt in phase 1. These are HTML,CSS,JavaScript, DOM Manipulation,Event Handling and Communicating with the server.

# Project Setup

The setup of this project followed a number of steps:
- The planning process:

1. The use of Figma to draw out the idea of how I want the page to look like.

2. Developed the user stories.

3. Outlined the core features of my MVP

4. Selected the API that I shall use and ensured it was working.

After the planning,
I setup the files I needed and started the coding of the project.

# Project Requirements

1. Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap or Tailwind frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

2. Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3. Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

4. Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

5. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

# Requirements
